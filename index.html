		<h1> Richard Garces </h1>
			<p> 
			Hello, I am Richard Garces, your average random person that tries to make themself laugh even after a rough time. 
			I have short term memory and anxiety problems. 
			The first time I started working with software was in 2013 with C++ in an Intro to Engineering course in high school. 
			Currently I work full-time and am taking three courses in Computer Programming, working 5 or 6 days and studying sleepless nights. 
			I love Gundam, something about animated war stories and some cruel reality mixed with fiction of robots fighting is like a smoothie blended in harmony.
			</p>
		<h3> What I do when I'm bored </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> A. Play video games </li>
				<li> B. Indulge myself in Japanese culture (Anime / Manga) </li>
				<li> C. Drink boba or some tea to relax </li>
			</ul>
		
		<p> My favorite website  is <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/">Crunchyroll</a> since it has a library of Anime to watch that it can be like a candy shop. So much to watch, with oh so little time.</p>
